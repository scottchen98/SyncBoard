# Project Overview

This project is a real-time collaborative Kanban board web application designed to facilitate project management and task visualization. It allows users to create boards, add cards representing tasks, and manage their workflow by dragging and dropping cards between different stages ("To Do," "In Progress," "Done"). All changes made to the board are reflected instantly across all connected devices.

## Tech Stack

**Backend:** ASP.NET, Neon \
**Real-time communication:** SignalR \
**Frontend:** React, TanStack Query, react-beautiful-dnd

## Target Audience

The project is aimed at individuals or teams looking for a simple-to-use, visually engaging and collaborative tool to organize tasks, visualize workflows, and collaborate effectively in real time. 

## Key Features

### Real-time Collaboration

- Multiple users can view and update the board simultaneously, ensuring everyone stays on the same page.

### Card Management

- Add new cards for new tasks.
- Drag and drop cards between stages to manage workflow.
- Reorder cards within the same or different columns for prioritization.
- Delete cards when tasks are completed.

## Personal Motivation

The development of this project served as a personal learning experience to explore and implement various technologies. It provided an opportunity to:

- Gain experience in building real-time applications with ASP.NET and SignalR.
- Enhance my frontend development skills by implementing a drag-and-drop Kanban board using the react-beautiful-dnd library.
- Challenge myself by tackling the implementation of real-time communication using SignalR.
- Experience the satisfaction of building a functional and user-friendly application that can potentially benefit others.
